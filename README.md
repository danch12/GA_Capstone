## Introduction
Looking across the internet I saw that Lending Club (a peer to peer lending company) releases a massive amount of data every quarter on the status of every loan opened with them during that quarter. Therefore I thought it would be really interesting to predict the outcome of loans based on information you would know during the lifetime of the loan.The results of this project could have an exciting impact on how Lending Club looks at it's loanees as if we can predict a loan is going to default then we can take preventative measures to stop the loan from defaulting. Additionally as predicting the outcome of loans is quite difficult, it required me to seek out niche, powerful techniques that were previously unknown to me.
